## Compiling the firmware
Download STM32CubeIDE from https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html and install it (the IDE is also required by Robot firmware).

Open the IDE by, for example, searching "STM32CubeIDE".

Import the project for Drone firmware by `File -> Open projects from file system` and select this directory as the `import source`.

Compile the firmware by `Project -> Build Project` and you will find the binary at `Debug/Drone.elf`.
